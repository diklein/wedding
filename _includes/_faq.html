  <span class="f3 sans">An FAQ? Why?</span>
  <p class="f4 serif">
    There's always so many questions when a wedding is approaching. This page will be updated to address the questions that we receive.
  </p>

  <span class="f3 sans">What is the wedding attire?</span>
  <p class="serif f4">
    Cocktail attire. Suits for men and cocktail dresses for women. Women, please bring a pashmina as it may get chilly during dinner.

  <span class="f3 sans">Will there be kids?</span>
  <p class="serif f4">
    We love your babies and kids and teenagers. Really, we do. However, this will be a kid, baby, and teenager-free weekend.
  </p>

  <span class="f3 sans">Is there transportation?</span>
  <p class="serif f4">
    All weekend festivities are walking distance within the town of Healdsburg. If you are staying outside of Healdsburg consider Lyft, a taxi, or a car service.

  <span class="f3 sans">Who took the amazing photos on this website?</span>
  <p class="serif f4">
    Kate Munsch! She's fantastic. <a href="https://www.katedocumentary.com" class="link dim blue underline">https://www.katedocumentary.com</a>

  <span class="f3 sans">This website is so fast! How did you do it?</span>
  <p class="serif f4">
    Well, it starts with using my own <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" class="link dim blue underline">DigitalOcean</a> SSD-based virtual server running <a href="https://www.nginx.com" class="link dim blue underline">NGINX</a>. Then I drop a little <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" class="link dim blue underline">Jekyll</a> on that server to produce static HTML files. What does that mean? The server only needs to send over a few snippets of text to your device. Then I have all of the CSS placed in the head of each page, so you don't need to wait for an external file to load. Fewer server calls means faster load time. Lastly, I'm using <a href="https://www.imgix.com" class="link dim blue underline">imgix</a> to optimize and deliver the photos. Neat, right?
